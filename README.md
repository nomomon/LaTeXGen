# LaTeXGen

![cover](./assets/cover.jpeg)

Webapp for creating self-generating mathematical problems in LaTeX and Markdown using JavaScript.

## What's this about

LaTeXGen lets you write problem templates with variables — think LaTeX meets code. You define parameters with JavaScript, and the app generates randomized problem instances from your template. Great for teachers who want unique problem sets, or students who want infinite practice.

Uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for LaTeX rendering and [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for Markdown parsing. Everything runs client-side, no server needed.

## How to launch

Just open it in a browser:

```
open app/index.html
```

Or visit the [live demo](https://nomomon.github.io/LaTeXGen/).
